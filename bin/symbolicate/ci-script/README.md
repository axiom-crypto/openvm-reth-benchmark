# Symboliate Profile

Symbolicates a `profile.json` with no symbols into a `profile-symbolicated.json` with symbols. Requires samply symbolication server to be running (which is taken care of in this script). **From the root of the repository**, run:

```bash
node bin/symbolicate/ci-script/symbolicate.js
```
